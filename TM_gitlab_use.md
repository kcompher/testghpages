### WIP: Get David to flesh out


#### Why use GitLab?

- Git is obviously great for versioning and source code managment, but gitlab is also a great collaboration and project management tool.

- By putting work in progress in addition to final data products, reports and analyses, the Office of Analytics Research (OAR) can use gitlab to track the groups work activity.
	- Check out some of the analytic reports and charts that show [activity](https://git.sec.gov/compherk/gitguide/graphs/master/charts) and [commits](https://git.sec.gov/compherk/gitguide/network/master).

- Gitlab enable code and methodoligical discovery, reuse and sharing. It also helps provide posterity and track the evolution and lineage of your work.
	- This project has been forked many time!!!


Gitlab can act as the central repository for projects across diverse computing environments.
